## Introduction

This is my second project overall, also coming from the [Odin Project Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).
I'm rather someone with a lot of original and creative ideas, so for me the top goal on this proyect was to stick to the design template. See: [reference](./reference-images) 

## Self impose Goals

- ✅ Faithful to the original design template
- ✅ Decent Mobile responsiveness from flexbox & media queries
- ✅ Sticky Navbar with seamless gradient
- ✅ Navbar #links aligns with containers
- ✅ Fix background & fix section background
- ✅ Pleasently looking box-shadows & regions opacity
- ✅ Sign-up button takes to 404 page


## To-do list:
- ⏳ Draggable and inertia based images and single letter pool-like fisics
- ⏳ Add alternative color palette
